     * This method can be called to create a new transaction. If accepted by this method, the newly-created transaction
     * will eventually be embedded inside a newly-created event as long as the node does not shut down before getting
     * around to it. As long as this node is healthy, with high probability the transaction will reach consensus, but
     * this is not a hard guarantee.
     * <p>
     * This method will sometimes reject new transactions. Some (but not necessarily all) causes for a transaction to be
     * rejected by this method:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>the node is starting up</li>
     * <li>the node is performing a reconnect</li>
     * <li>the node is preparing for an upgrade</li>
     * <li>the node is unable to submit transactions fast enough and has built up a backlog</li>
     * <li>the node is having health problems</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * Transactions have a maximum size defined by the setting "transactionMaxBytes". If a transaction larger than
     * this is submitted, this method will always reject it.
     *
     * @param transaction the transaction to handle in binary format (format used is up to the application)
     * @return true if the transaction is accepted, false if it is rejected. Being accepted does not guarantee that the
     * transaction will ever reach consensus, only that this node will make a best-effort attempt to make that happen.
