/**
 * Instance-wide config for {@code MerkleDbDataSource}.
 *
 * @param maxNumOfKeys
 * 		Get the maximum number of unique keys we expect to be stored in this database. This is used for
 * 		calculating in memory index sizes. IMPORTANT: This can only be set before a new database is created, changing
 * 		on an existing database will break it.
 * @param hashesRamToDiskThreshold
 * 		Get threshold where we switch from storing node hashes in ram to
 * 		storing them on disk. If it is 0 then everything is on disk, if it is Long.MAX_VALUE then everything is in ram.
 * 		Any value in the middle is the path value at
 * 		which we swap from ram to disk. This allows a tree where the lower levels of the tree nodes hashes are in ram
 * 		and the upper larger less changing layers are on disk. IMPORTANT: This can only be set before a new database is
 * 		created, changing on an existing database will break it.
 * @param minNumberOfFilesInCompaction
 * 		The minimum number of files before we do a compaction. If there are less than this number then it is
 * 		acceptable to not do a compaction.
 * @param reconnectKeyLeakMitigationEnabled
 * 		There currently exists a bug when a virtual map is reconnected that can
 * 		cause some deleted keys to leak into the datasource. If this method returns true then a mitigation strategy is
 * 		used when a leaked key is encountered, which hides the problem from the perspective of the application. This
 * 		setting exists so that we can test behavior with and without this mitigation enabled. This mitigation should
 * 		always be enabled in production environments.
 * @param keySetBloomFilterHashCount
 * 		Configuration used during a reconnect. The number of hashes used per element
 * 		inserted into a bloom filter. The number of elements that may be inserted into the bloom filter is equal to the
 * 		number of leaf nodes transmitted during the reconnect for a single virtual map. This value should be chosen so
 * 		that the bloom filter has an acceptable false positive rate when a number of elements equal to the largest
 * 		virtual map in the state are inserted into the bloom filter.
 * @param keySetBloomFilterSizeInBytes
 * 		Configuration used during a reconnect. The in-memory size of the bloom filter, in bytes. This value should be
 * 		chosen so that the bloom filter has an acceptable false positive rate when a number of elements equal to the
 * 		largest virtual map in the state are inserted into the bloom filter. This value should be chosen with the memory
 * 		available during a reconnect kept in mind. Only one such bloom filter will be in memory at any specific point in
 * 		time.
 * @param keySetHalfDiskHashMapSize
 * 		Configuration used during a reconnect. A half disk hash map is instanced during a reconnect. This parameter
 * 		configures the size of the half disk hash map. The number of elements that may be inserted into the half disk
 * 		hash map is equal to the number of leaf nodes transmitted during the reconnect for a single virtual map. This
 * 		number should be chosen so that it accommodates the largest virtual map in the state.
 * @param keySetHalfDiskHashMapBuffer
 * 		Configuration used during a reconnect. This configures the size of an in-memory buffer that is used when
 * 		writing to the half disk hash map configured by {@link #keySetHalfDiskHashMapSize()}.
 * @param indexRebuildingEnforced
 * 		Configuration used to avoid reading stored indexes from a saved state and enforce rebuilding those indexes from
 * 		data files.
 * @param percentHalfDiskHashMapFlushThreads
 *      Percentage, from 0.0 to 100.0, of available processors to use for half disk hash map background flushing
 *      threads.
 * @param numHalfDiskHashMapFlushThreads
 *      Number of threads to use for half disk hash map background flushing. If set to a negative value, the number of
 *      threads to use is calculated based on {@link #percentHalfDiskHashMapFlushThreads}
 * @param reservedBufferLengthForLeafList
 *      Length of a reserved buffer in a LongList used to store leafs. Value in bytes.
 * @param leafRecordCacheSize
 *      Cache size in bytes for reading virtual leaf records. Initialized in data source creation time from MerkleDb config.
 *      If the value is zero, leaf records cache isn't used.
